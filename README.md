# ML Pipeline: EDA, model training, hyper-parameter optimization and model comparison

Machine learning skills are applied to predict survivals in the Titanic data.
Codes include data exploration/analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, building ML models, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning and comparing the models.
Pipeline and column transformers are also employed.

### Exploratory_data_analysis
This code performs a basic exploratory analysis

### Train_optimize_and_compare
This code performs tarining different classifiers, cross-validating to check model performance, optimizing hyper-parameters.
Finally, cross validation is performed again but with best_model parametrs to be able to compare with the previous values.
